# Explorations

## Introduction

Explorations are the final level of our journey.  The purpose of an exploration is to to dive deeply into a topic around GitSecOps and  and produce a repeatable body of work so that others can learn from your journey. 


**Explorations can be iterative!** The exploration process can be repeated as you continue to learn more about the topic and deepen your understanding. It's important to be open-minded and willing to revise your understanding as you gather new information and insights. Exploratory learning can be an iterative process, and it's okay to make mistakes along the way, as long as you learn from them

??? Harma "How and Why Explorations work"

    Explorations can be a powerful tool for learning because they allow people to pragmatically interact with the technology.  When people are given the opportunity to explore, they can ask questions, make predictions, and test their ideas in a way that helps them construct their own knowledge and understanding. This can lead to a greater sense of ownership and engagement with the material, which can in turn enhance motivation and learning outcomes. Additionally, explorations can provide a way for people to learn from and with others, which can foster collaboration and social interaction, both of which are important for learning and development.

    Here is a general process for exploratory learning:

    * Identify a topic or concept that you want to learn more about.
    * Gather information about the topic through various sources, such as books, articles, lectures, and discussions with experts or peers.
    * Formulate questions and hypotheses about the topic.
    * Engage in hands-on activities or experiments to test your ideas and gather data.
    * Analyze the data and draw conclusions based on your findings.
    * Reflect on the learning process and what you have learned.
    * Share your findings and insights with others.


## Current areas in need of exploration  

Here are some of the areas we are currently looking to explore:

* Using an Artifact Server
* Hardening Containers
* Kubernetes PaaS
* Observability with Open Telemtry
* Open Policy Agent (OPA)
* Service Mesh with Istio
* Spiffe and spire 
* Knative
* Crossplane


## Requirements for publication to this site
You do not have to aim to have your exploration published on this site.  However, if you do want us to publish here, then your exploration must meet the following minimum requirements:

* The workshop design principles must be incorporated
* Exploration must use the technology stack introduced as part of this workshop (Github, Tekton, ArgoCD, Kind, kubernetes).  You can add variations or show different ways of doing things, but you must include the core stack.  This makes it easier for other to follow along.
* Security must be a core part of the exploration.
* To maintain repeatability, the JuiceShop, StudentBook, or bookinfo application should be used as the underlying application.  .
* A How-to/walkthrough/tutorial guide must be included. Please copy the format of the other explorations already published 

## Suggested Process
1. Complete research into one of the explorations listed above or embark on a unique one.
2. Using the sample proposal template as a guideline. create a README, Presentation, Miro board etc outlining your proposal.  
3. Ask some peers to review your proposal for feedback.
4. Complete your exploration, make sure to include, howto/tutorial/walkthrough that someone can use to reproduce your exploration in a hands on manner
5. Request for your Exploration to be added to the this page. 
6. If desired, complete a Reflection like you did for the Capstone project.
