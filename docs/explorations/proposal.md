# Title: Exploring Kubernetes for Container Orchestration


## Purpose: The purpose of this exploration is to gain a deeper understanding of Kubernetes and how it can be used for container orchestration.

## Objectives: The objectives of this exploration are to:

* Learn the basics of Kubernetes and container orchestration
* Deploy a sample application using Kubernetes
* Experiment with different features and capabilities of Kubernetes
* Understand the benefits and challenges of using Kubernetes in production environments

## Methods: The methods that will be used for this exploration include:

* Reading and studying documentation and tutorials on Kubernetes
* Setting up a Kubernetes cluster and deploying sample applications
* Testing and experimenting with different features and capabilities of Kubernetes
* Participating in online forums and communities to ask questions and learn from others

## Timeline: The timeline for this exploration is as follows:

* Week 1: Read and study documentation and tutorials on Kubernetes (duration: 1 week)
* Week 2: Set up a Kubernetes cluster and deploy a sample application (duration: 1 week)
* Week 3: Experiment with different features and capabilities of Kubernetes (duration: 1 week)

## Resources: The resources that will be needed for this exploration include:

* A computer with internet access
* A Kubernetes cluster (this can be set up using a cloud provider or on-premises using tools such as Minikube)
* Sample applications to deploy on the Kubernetes cluster

## Expected Outcomes: The expected outcomes of this exploration are:

* A deeper understanding of Kubernetes and how it can be used for container orchestration
* Hands-on experience deploying applications using Kubernetes
* Insights into the benefits and challenges of using Kubernetes in production environments

## Evaluation: The exploration will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* Depth of understanding of Kubernetes and container orchestration
* Successful deployment of sample applications using Kubernetes
* Quality of insights and reflections on the benefits and challenges of using Kubernetes in production environments

## Budget: The budget for this exploration is as follows:

* No budget is required for this exploration, as all necessary resources are free or can be accessed through free trials.

## Additional Questions to consider  

**Why should we solve it?**
* Why is this an important problem for us to solve?
* Is it a big enough problem to solve?
* Should we solve it now, or later?
* Provide specific data (quantitative or qualitative) wherever possible.

**How do you propose to solve it?**
* Add details of your proposed change. This can be high-level as psuedocode and sketches of the architecture, or as low-level as Protocol Buffer and interface definitions. Decide what the context of the proposal is, and write appropriately.
* Be explicit about what you are optimising for in this proposed solution â€” for example, 'we need to hit this deadline, so we'll accept the tech debt this entails'.

**What other approaches did you consider?**
* In general, it's a red-flag if you haven't thought of a couple of different ways that you could approach the problem.
* What does your proposed solution give you that these approaches don't?
* What are they optimising for that isn't appropriate in this case?

**What could go wrong?**
* What risks does your proposed change entail?
* How will you mitigate them?
* How could this system fail, and what would be the impact if it did?
