# 3.Bifurcated Pipeline 

## Introduction

In this scenario, we are going to split or bifurcate the testing stage into two separate pipelines to simulate isolating security testing.  A bifurcated CI/CD pipeline is a pipeline that is divided or split into two or more separate parts or stages. The purpose of a bifurcated pipeline is to separate different stages of the pipeline so that each stage can be managed and optimized independently.

In this case we are choosing to separate security-related stages from other stages. For example, you might have a separate stage for security testing, or a separate pipeline for security-related tasks, such as scans and checks. This can help improve the security of your pipeline and ensure that security is a top priority throughout the development process.

Having a separate CI/CD pipeline for security testing can bring several benefits:

??? Harma "Improved security"
    By dedicating a separate pipeline for security testing, you can ensure that security tests are run consistently and regularly, and that security issues are caught early in the development process. This can help you prevent security breaches and improve the overall security of your applications and infrastructure.

??? Harma "Better control"
    Having a separate pipeline for security testing allows you to easily monitor and manage the security testing process, and to make changes to the tests or the pipeline as needed. This can help you keep your security testing up-to-date and effective.

??? Harma "Faster feedback" 
    By running security tests in a separate pipeline, you can get faster feedback on the results of the tests. This can help you quickly identify and fix security issues, and avoid delays in the development process.

??? Harma "Improved collaboration" 
    Having a separate pipeline for security testing can help improve collaboration between the development and security teams. The security team can be responsible for setting up and maintaining the security tests and pipeline, while the development team can focus on writing and delivering code.
